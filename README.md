This was the project for my algorithms course that I took in Spring 2019.

The premise of the problem is stated as follows: "You have some number of bots lost in the city. Your goal is to find these bots and move them home in the shortest time. You have two operations, both that take some time: remote and scout. A remote moves all bots from a vertex to a neighbour of that vertex. A scout sends a student to a vertex and has the student report if a bot is there."
